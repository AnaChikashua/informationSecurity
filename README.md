# Python Implementation of SHA-256 from Scratch
### SHA-256

This project provides a Python implementation of the SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) cryptographic hash function from scratch. The SHA-256 algorithm is widely used for ensuring data integrity and security in various applications.

## Features
- Complete implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm in Python.
- Supports hashing of input messages of any length.
- Generates a 256-bit hash value for the input message.
- Easy-to-understand code structure with detailed comments.
## Usage
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sha256-implementation.git
```
